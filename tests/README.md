# Tests

Here you can find some of the tests and prototypes that have been carried out throughout the project, as well as the basic implementations of the resources that finally give rise to the final version of the program.

The following can be distinguished:
- **filter:** Program that processes point clouds and filters them based on distance.
- **downsampling:** Test codes that reduces samples in the point clouds in order to be able to be aligned, reducing the computational load.
- **noise_removal:** Test codes that perform the removal of possible existing noise in different point clouds.
- **segmentation:** Test codes that clusters points into distinct semantic parts representing surfaces, objects, or structures in the environment.
- **alignement:** Test codes that align consecutive point clouds using different methods, such as feature extraction.
