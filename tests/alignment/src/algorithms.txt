ALIGNMENT TEST ALGORITHMS

icp_algorithm_v1-0 -> simply version of icp algorithm (there is rotation)
icp_algorithm_v1-1 -> version 1 + publish only last cloud
icp_algorithm_v3 -> version 1 + downsampling + extract features
icp_algorithm_v5 -> version 1 + downsampling + extract features FPFH + RANSAC filtre
icp_algorithm_v7 -> version 5 + circular buffer
* icp_algorithm_v10 -> version 7 + only update new points in accumulated cloud
icp_algorithm_v10-1 -> version 10 + without FPFH and RANSAC

* it is the most updated version
