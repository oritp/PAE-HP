ICP Test Algorithms

icp_algorithm_v1-0 -> simply version of icp algorithm (there is rotation)
icp_algorithm_v1-1 -> version 1 + publish only last cloud
icp_algorithm_v3 -> version 1 + downsampling + extract features
icp_algorithm_v5 -> version 1 + downsampling + extract features FPFH + RANSAC filtre
icp_algorithm_v7 -> version 5 + circular buffer
* icp_algorithm_v8 -> version 7 + trajectory estimation

* it is the most updated version
