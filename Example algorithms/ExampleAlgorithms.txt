Algorithms with Github Links:

KISS-ICP: https://github.com/PRBonn/kiss-icp
Description:    Point-based ICP.
                Novel idea: adaptative thresholding for ICP registration.
                Constant-velocity motion prediction (both for within and between frames).
                CPU only, code already optimized.

Livox LOAM: https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_mapping
Description:    Feature extraction: planes, edges.
                Feature tracking by ICP in adjacent scans.
                Motion solved by Levenberg-Marquardt.
                Optional loop closure.
                CPU only. Number of threads used for ICP can be controlled.

Livox LIO: https://github.com/Livox-SDK/LIO-Livox
Description:    Feature extraction: planes, isolated points
                Optionally filter dynamic objects
                Optionally can use IMU

FAST-LIO2: https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO
Description:    Point-based + IMU
                iEKF, ikd-Tree

FF-LINS: https://github.com/i2Nav-WHU/FF-LINS
Description:
