HP Example:     https://github.com/ramonvp/pae_q1_2425

KISS-ICP:       https://github.com/PRBonn/kiss-icp
Description:    Point-based ICP.
                Novel idea: adaptative thresholding for ICP registration.
                Constant-velocity motion prediction (both for within and between frames).
                CPU only, code already optimized.

Livox LOAM:     https://github.com/hku-mars/loam_livox
Livox Mapping:  https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_mapping
Description:    Feature extraction: planes, edges.
                Feature tracking by ICP in adjacent scans.
                Motion solved by Levenberg-Marquardt.
                Optional loop closure.
                CPU only. Number of threads used for ICP can be controlled.

Livox LIO:      https://github.com/Livox-SDK/LIO-Livox
Description:    Feature extraction: planes, isolated points
                Optionally filter dynamic objects
                Optionally can use IMU

FAST-LIO2:      https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO
Description:    Point-based + IMU
                iEKF, ikd-Tree
